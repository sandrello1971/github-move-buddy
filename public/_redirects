# Redirects and rewrites for Cloudflare Pages / Netlify

# Social share routes - these are handled by Cloudflare Pages Functions
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT redirect /share/* to index.html - let Functions handle it
# Functions take precedence in Cloudflare Pages, but we need to ensure
# the catch-all rule below doesn't interfere

# SPA fallback - serve index.html for all other routes EXCEPT /share/*
# Note: In Cloudflare Pages, Functions at /functions/share/[slug].ts
# automatically handle /share/:slug routes, so this redirect won't affect them
/*    /index.html   200
